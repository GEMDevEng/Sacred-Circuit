# Implementation Plan for AI Coding Agent: Sacred Healing Companion & Journey Hub

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Implementation Plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for the AI Coding Agent to assist in developing the Sacred Healing Companion & Journey Hub, a web-based spiritual wellness platform. The plan outlines specific tasks, dependencies, and prompts to guide the AI in generating code, ensuring alignment with the project’s requirements, security standards, and privacy commitments. By following this plan, the AI will help deliver a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by June 2025, meeting the needs of young adults aged 18–35 who value spirituality and privacy.

### 1.2 Scope
The plan covers the following phases, derived from the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and other project documents:
- **Planning**: Environment setup and requirements review.
- **Development**: Frontend, backend, and third-party integrations.
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
- **Deployment**: Hosting configuration and application launch.
- **Maintenance**: Post-launch support and updates.

Each phase includes tasks with detailed instructions or prompts for the AI to execute, focusing on coding tasks where the AI’s assistance is most valuable. The plan references the Product Requirements Document (PRD), Software Requirements Specification (SRS), Frontend Guidelines, Backend Structure, Tech Stack, Security Guidelines, and Project Rules to ensure consistency.

### 1.3 Audience
This document is intended for:
- **AI Coding Agent**: To follow a structured sequence of tasks and prompts for code generation.
- **Developers**: To integrate AI-generated code into the project and provide feedback.
- **Project Managers**: To track progress and ensure timely completion.
- **Stakeholders**: To understand the development process and AI’s role.

### 1.4 Assumptions
- The AI Coding Agent has access to the project’s GitHub repository and necessary API keys (e.g., OpenAI, Airtable, Mailchimp).
- The AI can generate code in JavaScript (React, Node.js) and follow provided guidelines.
- Manual setup for third-party services (e.g., Typeform, Mailchimp) will be handled by the development team, with the AI assisting in code-related tasks.
- The project timeline allows for 12 weeks of development, targeting completion by June 2025.

## 3. Guidelines for AI Coding Agent
To ensure the AI Coding Agent stays on track, it must follow these guidelines:

- **Adherence to Standards**: Strictly follow the coding standards, best practices, and security rules outlined in the [Project Rules](#) document.
- **Prompt Clarity**: Use the provided prompts as the primary guide for code generation. If a prompt is unclear, generate code based on the PRD and SRS, prioritizing user privacy and spiritual aesthetic.
- **Error Handling**: Include try-catch blocks for all asynchronous operations (e.g., API calls, database queries). Provide user-friendly error messages (e.g., “Unable to send message, please try again”) and log detailed errors to Sentry.
- **Security Implementation**: Implement security measures such as HTTPS, JWT validation, input sanitization, and Zero Data Retention (ZDR) for OpenAI API calls. Ensure GDPR compliance and use Healing Names for anonymity.
- **Testing Integration**: Generate tests alongside code for every task, targeting 80% code coverage. Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests as specified.
- **Documentation**: Document all generated code with JSDoc comments and update relevant markdown files (e.g., `README.md`, `deployment.md`) with clear instructions.
- **Iteration**: Be prepared to refine generated code based on test results or feedback, maintaining consistency with existing code.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize frontend assets (e.g., images in WebP format) and minimize API calls to achieve page load times under 3 seconds and chatbot responses under 2 seconds.
- **Version Control**: Commit changes with descriptive messages (e.g., `feat: Implement LandingPage component`) and push to the appropriate branch (e.g., `feature/landing-page`).
