# Comprehensive Task List for Sacred Healing Companion & Journey Hub

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Task List document provides a detailed and comprehensive set of tasks for the AI Coding Agent to assist in developing the Sacred Healing Companion & Journey Hub, a web-based spiritual wellness platform. The tasks are derived from the project’s Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Implementation Plan, ensuring alignment with the Product Requirements Document (PRD), Software Requirements Specification (SRS), and other guiding documents. Each task specifies what the AI needs to generate—whether code, tests, or documentation—to contribute to a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by June 2025, meeting the needs of young adults aged 18–35 who value spirituality and privacy.

### 1.2 Scope
The task list covers all activities where the AI Coding Agent is expected to produce output, including:
- **Planning**: Environment setup and requirements review.
- **Development**: Frontend components, backend APIs, and third-party integrations.
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Deployment**: Hosting configuration and application launch.
- **Maintenance**: Post-launch monitoring and update planning.

Tasks are organized by phase, with details on dependencies, expected outcomes, and priorities to guide the AI’s work.

### 1.3 Audience
This document is intended for:
- **AI Coding Agent**: To follow a structured sequence of tasks for code generation.
- **Developers**: To integrate AI-generated code and provide feedback.
- **Project Managers**: To track progress and ensure timely completion.
- **Stakeholders**: To understand the development tasks and AI’s role.

### 1.4 Assumptions
- The AI has access to the project’s GitHub repository and necessary API keys (e.g., OpenAI, Airtable, Mailchimp).
- The AI can generate JavaScript (React, Node.js), HTML, and markdown files following provided guidelines.
- Manual setups for third-party services (e.g., Typeform, Mailchimp) will be handled by the development team, with the AI generating related documentation.
- The project timeline allows for 12 weeks of development, targeting completion by June 2025.

## 2. Task List

The tasks are grouped by project phase for clarity and sequential execution. Each task includes a unique ID, name, description, dependencies, expected outcome, and priority level. Priorities are assigned based on criticality to core functionality:
- **High**: Essential for core features (e.g., chatbot, onboarding, testing).
- **Medium**: Important but not critical (e.g., documentation, integrations).
- **Low**: Enhancements or non-essential features (e.g., styling consistency, email templates).

## 3. Guidelines for AI Coding Agent
To ensure the AI Coding Agent executes tasks effectively, it must adhere to the following guidelines, derived from the Project Rules and Security Guidelines:

- **Coding Standards**:
  - Use JavaScript (ES6+) with React for frontend and Node.js/Express for backend.
  - Follow naming conventions: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components, kebab-case for files.
  - Format code with 2-space indentation, maximum 100-character line length, and Prettier rules.
  - Document all functions and components with JSDoc comments.

- **Security Measures**:
  - Use HTTPS for all communications, redirecting HTTP requests.
  - Store API keys in Vercel environment variables, never in client-side code.
  - Implement a consent toggle for conversation storage, defaulting to disabled.
  - Use OpenAI’s Zero Data Retention (ZDR) to prevent data use in model training.
  - Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent XSS and injection attacks.
  - Ensure GDPR compliance with a clear privacy policy and data deletion endpoint.

- **Project-Specific Requirements**:
  - Use Healing Names for user anonymity in all interactions.
  - Include a placeholder for Sacred Circuit’s custom chatbot prompts (e.g., `const sacredPrompt = "/* Custom prompt to be provided */";`).
  - Ensure reflection submissions are optional and avoid medical claims.
  - Design the UI with a calming, spiritual aesthetic using Tailwind CSS (soft blue `#6A9BD8`, warm beige `#F5F5DC`).

- **Testing**:
  - Generate tests for every coding task, targeting 80% code coverage.
  - Include unit tests (Jest), integration tests, and end-to-end tests (Cypress).
  - Test mobile responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

- **Documentation**:
  - Update `README.md` with setup, running, and deployment instructions.
  - Generate markdown files for third-party service setups and monitoring processes.
  - Commit changes with descriptive messages (e.g., `feat: Implement LandingPage component`).

- **Performance**:
  - Optimize frontend assets for page load times under 3 seconds.
  - Ensure chatbot responses are delivered within 2 seconds.

## 4. Task Execution Process
The AI Coding Agent should:
1. **Start with Planning Tasks**: Complete Tasks 1.1–1.3 to establish the project foundation.
2. **Prioritize High-Priority Tasks**: Focus on critical development tasks (e.g., chatbot interface, server setup, key endpoints) to ensure core functionality.
3. **Respect Dependencies**: Execute tasks only after their dependencies are complete.
4. **Generate Tests Concurrently**: Create tests alongside development tasks to maintain quality.
5. **Deploy and Monitor**: Finalize deployment tasks and set up monitoring for post-launch support.
6. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Be prepared to refine code or documentation based on test results or team feedback.

## 5. Timeline
The estimated timeline for task completion is 12 weeks, excluding ongoing maintenance:
- **Planning**: 2 weeks
- **Development**: 6 weeks
- **Testing**: 2 weeks
- **Deployment**: 1 week
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing post-launch

Tasks are prioritized to ensure critical features (e.g., chatbot, onboarding) are completed early, allowing for iterative testing and refinement.

## 6. Risk Management
Potential risks and mitigations include:
- **Unclear Custom Prompts**: Use placeholders for chatbot prompts, updating later when provided.
- **Third-Party Service Issues**: Implement retry logic for API calls and document manual setup steps clearly.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Strictly follow Security Guidelines, including input validation and ZDR.
- **Timeline Delays**: Parallelize non-dependent tasks and prioritize high-priority tasks to stay on schedule.

## 7. References
The AI Coding Agent should refer to the following project documents for detailed requirements:
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- App Flow Document
- Features Results Document
- Frontend Guidelines
- Backend Structure Document
- Tech Stack Document

## 8. Conclusion
This Task List document provides a detailed, comprehensive, and complete set of tasks for the AI Coding Agent to assist in developing the Sacred Healing Companion & Journey Hub. By following the outlined tasks, the AI will generate secure, high-quality code, tests, and documentation, ensuring the platform meets its goal of offering a private, spiritually-aligned healing experience for users by June 2025.
