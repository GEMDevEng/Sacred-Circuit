## 4. Guidelines for AI Coding Agent
To ensure the AI Coding Agent executes tickets effectively, it must adhere to the following guidelines, derived from the Project Rules and Security Guidelines:

- **Coding Standards**:
  - Use JavaScript (ES6+) with React for frontend and Node.js/Express for backend.
  - Follow naming conventions: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components, kebab-case for files.
  - Format code with 2-space indentation, maximum 100-character line length, and Prettier rules.
  - Document all functions and components with JSDoc comments.

- **Security Measures**:
  - Use HTTPS for all communications, redirecting HTTP requests.
  - Store API keys in Vercel environment variables, never in client-side code.
  - Implement a consent toggle for conversation storage, defaulting to disabled.
  - Use OpenAI’s Zero Data Retention (ZDR) to prevent data use in model training.
  - Sanitize and validate all user inputs using libraries like `validator.js` or `Joi`.
  - Ensure GDPR compliance with a clear privacy policy and data deletion endpoint.

- **Project-Specific Requirements**:
  - Use Healing Names for user anonymity in all interactions.
  - Include a placeholder for Sacred Circuit’s custom chatbot prompts (e.g., `const sacredPrompt = "/* Custom prompt to be provided */";`).
  - Ensure reflection submissions are optional and avoid medical claims.
  - Design the UI with a calming, spiritual aesthetic using Tailwind CSS (soft blue `#6A9BD8`, warm beige `#F5F5DC`).

- **Testing**:
  - Generate tests for every coding ticket, targeting 80% code coverage.
  - Include unit tests (Jest), integration tests, and end-to-end tests (Cypress).
  - Test mobile responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

- **Documentation**:
  - Update `README.md` with setup, running, and deployment instructions.
  - Generate markdown files for third-party service setups and monitoring processes.
  - Commit changes with descriptive messages (e.g., `feat: Implement LandingPage component`).

- **Performance**:
  - Optimize frontend assets for page load times under 3 seconds.
  - Ensure chatbot responses are delivered within 2 seconds.

## 5. Ticket Execution Process
The AI Coding Agent should follow this process to execute tickets:
1. **Prioritize Tickets**: Start with high-priority tickets (e.g., SHC-002, SHC-005, SHC-008) to establish core functionality.
2. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are complete before starting a ticket.
3. **Execute Prompt**: Use the ticket’s prompt or description to generate code, tests, or documentation.
4. **Verify Acceptance Criteria**: Test the output against the acceptance criteria to confirm completion.
5. **Commit and Document**: Commit changes to the GitHub repository with a clear message linking to the ticket ID (e.g., `SHC-005: Implement ChatbotInterface`). Update relevant documentation.
6. **Update Ticket Status**: Mark the ticket as completed in the project management tool (e.g., move to ‘Done’ in Trello).

## 6. Timeline
The estimated timeline for ticket completion is 12 weeks, excluding ongoing maintenance:
- **Planning**: 2 weeks (SHC-001–SHC-003)
- **Development**: 6 weeks (SHC-004–SHC-016)
- **Testing**: 2 weeks (SHC-017–SHC-019)
- **Deployment**: 1 week (SHC-020–SHC-021)
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing post-launch (SHC-022–SHC-023)

Tickets are prioritized to ensure critical features (e.g., chatbot, onboarding) are completed early, allowing for iterative testing and refinement.

## 7. Risk Management
Potential risks and mitigations include:
- **Unclear Custom Prompts**: Use placeholders for chatbot prompts, updating later when provided (SHC-009, SHC-012).
- **Third-Party Service Issues**: Generate clear documentation for manual setups (SHC-013, SHC-015) and implement retry logic for API calls (SHC-009, SHC-010).
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Adhere to Security Guidelines, including input validation and ZDR (SHC-009–SHC-011).
- **Timeline Delays**: Prioritize high-priority tickets and parallelize non-dependent tasks to stay on schedule.
