# Project Proposal: Sacred Healing Companion & Journey Hub

## Executive Summary

We are pleased to submit this proposal for the completion of your "Private GPT + Sacred Healing Hub Integration" project. After reviewing your requirements and developing a proof of concept (PoC), we are confident in our ability to deliver a fully functional Sacred Healing Companion & Journey Hub ahead of your June 1, 2025 deadline.

Our team has already developed a working prototype deployed on Vercel for your review, demonstrating our technical capabilities and understanding of your vision for a "sanctuary for sovereign healing." We propose a long-term retainer relationship to not only complete the current project but also support future enhancements and maintenance as your platform grows beyond the initial 50-100 users.

Your emphasis on user privacy, sovereignty, and a heart-centered approach aligns with our development philosophy, and we have prioritized these values in our proof of concept.
