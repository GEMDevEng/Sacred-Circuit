# Security Guidelines for Secure Application Development

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides comprehensive security guidelines for developing a secure application. The focus is on embedding strong security practices throughout the development lifecycle to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the application’s integrity. These guidelines align with the Security Requirements Checklist to create a robust and trustworthy system.

### 1.2 Scope
The guidelines address:
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Row-level security and access policies
- Secure management of secrets and keys
- Data handling and protection
- Frontend and client-side security
- Attack surface reduction strategies
- Logging and monitoring practices

### 1.3 Audience
This document targets:
- **Developers**: To implement secure coding practices.
- **System Architects**: To design secure infrastructure.
- **Project Managers**: To understand security priorities and requirements.

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

### 2.1 Authentication
- **Secure Auth Systems**: Implement a trusted authentication framework such as Supabase Auth, Firebase Auth, or a custom JSON Web Token (JWT)-based solution.
- **Password Policies**: Require passwords to have a minimum length of 12 characters, including a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Provide MFA as an optional feature using authenticator apps or SMS for enhanced user account security.
- **Session Management**: Use short-lived tokens (e.g., 15-minute expiration) with refresh tokens and enforce automatic logout after 30 minutes of inactivity.

### 2.2 Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define roles such as `user`, `admin`, and `moderator`. Enforce role checks on both frontend routing and backend API endpoints.
- **Token Validation**: Require a valid, signed token for all API requests, verified server-side using a secret key.
- **Protected Routes**: Restrict access to sensitive routes (e.g., `/admin`, `/user/profile`) to authenticated and authorized users only, returning a `403 Forbidden` response for unauthorized attempts.

## 3. Row-Level Security (RLS) & Policies

### 3.1 Row-Level Security
- **Database-Level RLS**: If using a database like PostgreSQL, enable RLS to restrict data access based on `user.id` or `user.role`. Example policy: `CREATE POLICY user_isolation ON table_name FOR ALL TO authenticated USING (auth_user_id = user.id);`.
- **Custom Implementation**: For databases without native RLS (e.g., Airtable), enforce equivalent logic in application code or API middleware.

### 3.2 Access Policies
- **User-Specific Access**: Filter data retrieval and updates to ensure users only interact with records tied to their `user.id` or a unique identifier.
- **Role-Based Policies**: Grant admins broader access (e.g., read/write across all records), but limit this through explicit checks (e.g., `if user.role != 'admin' then deny`).
- **API Enforcement**: Validate access rights at every API endpoint, rejecting requests that exceed a user’s scope with a `401 Unauthorized` response.

## 4. Secrets & Keys

### 4.1 Storage
- **Environment Variables**: Store API keys, database credentials, and tokens in `.env` files or a secure secret manager like AWS Secrets Manager or Vercel Environment Variables.
- **No Hardcoding**: Prohibit hardcoding secrets in source code; use static analysis tools to detect violations during CI/CD pipelines.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to secrets to authorized team members via role-based permissions in the secret manager.

### 4.2 Usage
- **Minimal Exposure**: Ensure secrets are never included in client-side code, logs, or error messages.
- **Key Rotation**: Rotate keys and tokens every 90 days or immediately after a suspected breach, using automated scripts where possible.

## 5. Data Handling

### 5.1 Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Frontend**: Use libraries like `validator.js` to sanitize inputs and block malicious patterns (e.g., `<script>` tags for XSS).
- **Backend**: Re-validate all inputs server-side using strict schemas (e.g., Joi or Zod) to prevent injection attacks like SQL injection or command injection.

### 5.2 Encryption
- **In Transit**: Enforce HTTPS with TLS 1.3 for all communications, redirecting HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- **At Rest**: Encrypt sensitive fields (e.g., emails, passwords) using AES-256 before storing in the database; store encryption keys separately in a secret manager.

### 5.3 Secure Cookies & Sessions
- **Cookies**: Configure cookies with `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=Strict` attributes to prevent interception and CSRF attacks.
- **Session Tokens**: Generate cryptographically secure, short-lived tokens (e.g., 32-byte random strings) using libraries like `crypto` in Node.js.

## 6. Frontend & Client-Side Rules

### 6.1 Sensitive Logic
- **Server-Side Validation**: Perform all authentication and authorization checks on the backend, not the client, to prevent bypass via browser tools.
- **Data Exposure**: Avoid storing tokens or sensitive data in `localStorage` or visible HTML; use secure memory-only variables instead.

### 6.2 Security Headers
- **CORS**: Set a strict CORS policy (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://trusted-domain.com`) to limit cross-origin requests.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Define a CSP header (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'`) to block unauthorized scripts and mitigate XSS.
- **Debug Removal**: Disable debug endpoints and strip console logs in production builds.

### 6.3 Vulnerability Mitigation
- **Open Redirects**: Validate redirect URLs against a whitelist (e.g., `if (!url.startsWith('https://myapp.com')) throw Error;`).
- **XSS & CSRF**: Use anti-CSRF tokens in forms and sanitize all user inputs with libraries like `DOMPurify`.

## 7. Attack Surface Reduction

### 7.1 Route Management
- **Disable Defaults**: Remove unused API routes and default endpoints (e.g., `/test`, `/debug`) during deployment.
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limits (e.g., 100 requests per minute per IP) using middleware like `express-rate-limit`.
- **Error Handling**: Return generic error messages (e.g., “Something went wrong”) instead of detailed stack traces.

### 7.2 Input Constraints
- **Length Validation**: Cap input fields (e.g., `maxLength: 255`) to prevent buffer overflows or denial-of-service attacks.
- **Type Checking**: Enforce strict type validation (e.g., reject non-numeric input for numeric fields).

## 8. Logging & Monitoring

### 8.1 Logging
- **Security Events**: Log failed login attempts, access control violations, and unexpected API requests with timestamps and user IDs.
- **Data Protection**: Exclude passwords, tokens, and personally identifiable information (PII) from logs; use redaction if necessary.
- **Centralized System**: Aggregate logs in a tool like ELK Stack or CloudWatch for analysis.

### 8.2 Monitoring
- **Anomaly Detection**: Track patterns like repeated failed logins or high request volumes, flagging them for review.
- **Alerts**: Configure real-time alerts for critical events (e.g., 10 failed logins in 5 minutes) via email or Slack.

## 9. Conclusion
Adhering to these security guidelines ensures the application is built with a defense-in-depth approach, safeguarding user data and system integrity. Regular reviews and updates to these practices will maintain a secure environment as the application evolves.
