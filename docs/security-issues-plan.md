# Security Issues Plan

This document outlines the plan for addressing security vulnerabilities and implementing security best practices in the Sacred Healing Hub application.

## Identified Security Issues

Based on the security audit, the following vulnerabilities have been identified:

### 1. Dependency Vulnerabilities

- **mailchimp-api-v3**: Depends on vulnerable versions of `request` and `tar`
- **vite**: Depends on vulnerable versions of `esbuild`
- **@babel/helpers**: Inefficient RegExp complexity
- **@eslint/plugin-kit**: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
- **cross-spawn**: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
- **nanoid**: Predictable results in nanoid generation
- **tough-cookie**: Prototype Pollution vulnerability

### 2. Missing Authentication Implementation

- No JWT implementation
- No protected routes
- No user authentication flow

### 3. Other Security Concerns

- Lack of CSRF protection
- Potential XSS vulnerabilities
- Insufficient input validation
- No rate limiting on some endpoints

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Dependency Vulnerabilities Remediation

#### 1.1 Update Dependencies

- Run `npm audit fix` to automatically fix vulnerabilities where possible
- For dependencies that cannot be automatically fixed:
  - Replace `mailchimp-api-v3` with a more secure alternative or implement a custom solution
  - Update `vite` to the latest version (may require breaking changes)
  - Pin dependencies to specific secure versions

#### 1.2 Regular Security Audits

- Set up automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Implement a process for regular dependency updates
- Document security update procedures

### 2. Authentication Implementation

#### 2.1 JWT Implementation

- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Use short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Implement secure token storage (HTTP-only cookies)
- Implement token refresh mechanism

#### 2.2 Password Security

- Implement strong password requirements
- Use bcrypt for password hashing
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Implement password reset functionality

#### 2.3 Protected Routes

- Implement route protection on the frontend
- Implement middleware for API route protection
- Implement role-based access control

### 3. CSRF Protection

- Implement CSRF tokens for all forms
- Validate CSRF tokens on the server
- Set proper cookie attributes (SameSite, Secure, HttpOnly)

### 4. XSS Protection

- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use React's built-in XSS protection
- Avoid dangerous patterns (e.g., dangerouslySetInnerHTML)

### 5. Input Validation

- Implement comprehensive server-side validation
- Enhance client-side validation
- Validate all user inputs, including query parameters and headers

### 6. Rate Limiting

- Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints
- Implement more aggressive rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Implement IP-based and user-based rate limiting

### 7. Secure Headers

- Enhance Helmet configuration
- Implement strict Content Security Policy
- Set proper CORS headers
- Implement Feature-Policy headers

### 8. Logging and Monitoring

- Implement security event logging
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- Implement audit trails for sensitive operations

## Implementation Timeline

   - Implement comprehensive rate limiting

5. Secure Headers and Logging (Day 6)
   - Enhance Helmet configuration
   - Implement security logging

6. Security Testing (Day 7)
   - Penetration testing
   - Security code review
   - Documentation

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication

- Use industry-standard authentication libraries
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Use secure password storage (bcrypt)
- Implement proper session management

### Authorization

- Implement principle of least privilege
- Use role-based access control
- Validate authorization on every request
- Implement proper error messages that don't leak information

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper data access controls
- Implement data minimization principles

### API Security

- Validate all inputs
- Implement rate limiting
- Use proper HTTP methods
- Return appropriate status codes
- Implement proper error handling

### Frontend Security

- Implement Content Security Policy
- Sanitize user inputs
- Avoid client-side storage of sensitive data
- Implement proper CORS configuration

### Monitoring and Response

- Log security events
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Have an incident response plan
- Regularly review security measures

## Regular Security Maintenance

- Conduct regular security audits
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Monitor security advisories
- Train team members on security best practices
- Review and update security documentation
