# TypeScript Fixes

This document outlines the TypeScript errors that were fixed in the codebase.

## 1. FileUpload Component

Fixed the TypeScript error with `fileInputRef.current` assignment in the FileUpload component. The issue was that we were trying to assign to a `RefObject` which is read-only by default.

**Solution:**
- Changed the ref type to use the standard `useRef<HTMLInputElement | null>(null)` without the explicit cast to `MutableRefObject`.

## 2. Button Component

Fixed the Button component mock to support the 'as' prop used in the ReflectionHistory component.

**Solution:**
- Updated the Button mock component in `src/__tests__/__mocks__/Button.tsx` to include the 'as' prop and other missing props.
- Added proper typing for the 'as' prop using `ElementType` from React.
- Updated the component implementation to handle rendering with different element types.

## 3. API Utility

Added the missing `requestPasswordReset` function to the API utility.

**Solution:**
- Added the `requestPasswordReset` function to `src/utils/api.ts`.
- Updated the ForgotPasswordForm component to use this function.
- Added proper error handling and success messaging.

## 4. Additional Fixes

### Form Component
- Updated the Form component to accept `null` as a valid value for the `error` prop.
- Fixed the Form test to use `document.querySelector` instead of `screen.getByRole('form')`.

### SentryErrorBoundary Component
- Fixed the SentryErrorBoundary component to use the correct `FallbackRender` type from Sentry.
- Removed the unused `FallbackProps` interface.
- Added the missing `type="button"` attribute to the button in the DefaultFallback component.

### FormInput and FormTextarea Components
- Fixed the unused 'value' variable in both components.
- Fixed the ARIA attribute `aria-invalid` to use string values 'true' or 'false' instead of boolean values.

### AuthResponse Type
- Updated the `role` property in the AuthResponse type to be more specific: `'user' | 'admin'` instead of `string`.

### ReflectionHistory Component
- Removed the unused `user` variable from the destructured `useAuth()` hook.

## Testing

All the fixes have been tested and verified to work correctly. The build process completes successfully without TypeScript errors.
